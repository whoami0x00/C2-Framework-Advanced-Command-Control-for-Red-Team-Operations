# C2-Framework-Advanced-Command-Control-for-Red-Team-Operations
This repository contains the source code, documentation, and configurations for an advanced Command &amp; Control (C2) framework designed for red team engagements. The framework is built to provide unparalleled stealth, flexibility, and adaptive capabilities, enabling operators to simulate realistic threat actor tactics for security testing purposes. 

Features
Dynamic Implant Management:
Cross-platform implants (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android).
Runtime evasion (Reflective DLL injection, direct syscalls).
Persistence mechanisms for resilient implants.

Stealthy Communication Channels:
Multi-vector communication protocols (HTTPS, DNS, SMB, ICMP).
Legitimate traffic mimicking with TLS fingerprint randomization.
Automated fallback to alternate channels when blocked.

Integrated LLM Intelligence:
Real-time recommendations for evasion and bypass strategies using fine-tuned LLM.
Knowledge of advanced EDR/AV bypass techniques (e.g., AMSI patching, ETW hooking).
Adaptive logic to counter sandboxing, heuristic analysis, and behavioral monitoring.

User-Friendly GUI:
Fully responsive dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Real-time implant monitoring, task scheduling, and log management.
Pre-configured templates for common red team scenarios.

Defense Awareness and Bypass:
Detection and evasion of modern EDR/AV systems.
Advanced techniques for lateral movement, pivoting, and privilege escalation.
Modules for bypassing Active Directory defenses, Credential Guard, and logging mechanisms.

Scalable Backend:
Python-based FastAPI server for task management and implant communication.
Modular architecture for seamless feature expansion.
Secure communication with encrypted payloads and transport.

Technology Stack
Backend: Python (FastAPI), SQLite/PostgreSQL for database operations.
Frontend: HTML, CSS (with responsive design), JavaScript (ES6+).
Implants: Rust for cross-platform stealth and performance.
LLM Integration: Hugging Face Transformers for real-time intelligence.

Usage
The framework is designed exclusively for authorized security testing and red team engagements. It provides the tools necessary to simulate realistic adversary behavior for testing and improving defensive measures within an organization.

Disclaimer
This framework is intended for educational purposes and authorized use only. Any misuse of this software for malicious purposes is strictly prohibited. Ensure compliance with all applicable laws and obtain proper authorization before deploying the framework.
